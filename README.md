ðŸ§  Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository serves as a collection of implementations and solutions related to core data structures and algorithmic problems. It reflects my learning process and practical exploration of computer science fundamentals through hands-on coding.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking and data structure design by implementing commonly used concepts and solving a variety of problems inspired by competitive programming and technical interviews.

ðŸš€ Features

Data Structures:
Implementations of fundamental structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables.

Algorithms:
Solutions to algorithmic challenges across topics including sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and more.
